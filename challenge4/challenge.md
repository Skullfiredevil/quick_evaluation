# Challenge 4: Making a Basic Web Application from Start to Finish!

### Description
In this challenge you will be asked to create a web application from scratch for a customer, this will include basic things 
you have done before in challenges 2 and 3. You will be given a brief and are free to approach the issue however you wish.


### Sources/Prerequisites
- You Should have everything you had before.

### The challenge
This time we will be making a multi-page website rather than a single page. This will use all the skills you had before and should teach you some good approaches to web development.

You will need to make 3 webpages:
1. index.html - Our homepage
2. contactus.html - A contact form page
3. login.html - A login page 

For this challenge you will be designing a webpage for your favourite food! It needs to be a generic thing like Ice-cream or Cake for example.

Using this theme you will need to make all the web content similar to how a company may wish to see it. You make it look anyway you wish and if you need some inspiration look [here](https://websitesetup.org/website-layouts/).

The Homepage `index.html` can contain any details for fun facts you would like etc to make it look legit.

Now the key thing is to test the skills you had in challenge 2 and 3, this means that the following must happen for the other two pages.

- `contactus.html` 
  - Must have a contact form for a user to submit a query, something similar to our website [here](https://www.yourmeds.net/contact)
  - This page must submit the inputted data to a `contact.php` script you create
  - `contact.php` must then check the user is inputting the correct data into the different form fields
  - `contact.php` will then once everything is validated respond with a 200 OK message and a json payload signifying success.
  - `contact.php` if it detects a validation error it should respond with a 400 Bad Request message
- `login.html`
  - Must look like a generic login page, use any inspiration you see fit
  - Must submit a username and password to `login.php`
  - `login.php` does not need to do anything for the moment
