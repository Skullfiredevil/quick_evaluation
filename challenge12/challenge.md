# Challenge 12: Using package managers for someone else's project and Basic debugging!

### Description

You have now seen how you can use Dependency management within your own project, but now you need to understand how to
use them outside your project. This example project is much more complicated than your current one but for this
challenge the main idea is to just get this one running and understand that process.

This scenario/challenge will be to resolve some bugs on a project you have never worked on before. This will test your
ability to follow instructions, read code and your understanding of all challenges covered before.

This situation is quite common as things go wrong or need changes, it is your job as the developer to be able to resolve
these even if you are not necessarily responsible for the issues. This could be considered routine for Freelancers or
within large organisations so to approximate this I have constructed a situation where you may not understand all the
workings of a project, but you should have a good enough grasp to fix simple issues.

### Sources/Prerequisites

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
2. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Download of the code within `res/`

### The challenge

The challenge is to get this project up and running in a routine fashion using the information contained with the
Project. You should not need any help with this part of the challenge, make sure you follow the instructions inside
the `res/README.md` file.

Once you have the project up and running you will then have to fix some issues that remain from the previous developer.

Use the webpage and fix the following:

- login page doesn't auto navigate when successfully logging in
- contact messages can no longer be saved.

While navigating through the code base bear in mind good techniques and bad ones. You should be mindful of which will
aid in your own project. 

### Completion Checklist

- [ ] Get the `res/` up and running
- [ ] Resolve the bug on the `contacts` page that is causing the project to no longer function
- [ ] Login is auto navigating on success
- [ ] Cleanup unused dependencies in `composer.json`

## Extras!

Now that you have seen some else's project and understood their thinking somewhat, find some good techniques used within
this project and put them into your code from challenge 11!
