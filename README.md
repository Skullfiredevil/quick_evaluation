# Quick Evaluation  
A repo with a quick and easy challenge to evaluate the ability of someone within my stack

## Troubleshooting issues
If you experience any issues with the challenges or runtime/environment issues please let someone know as these are not necessarily part of the challenge.

## What is this
Inside this repo you will find a series of directories/folders (these will be referred to as directories from now on), each contains a challenge that you should complete by following the instructions provided.

## How to use 

Inside the repo there are a number of directories, inside each directory are a set of challenges that are to be completed.

Each directory contains the following: 
```
- challenge.md
- res/
- .gitignore
```

There may be other files inside the directory but these can be ignored in order as they will be referenced within the `challenge.md`.

### Starting out
You should always start by opening the challenge.md file within the challenge directory you are completing.

All of your work should be submitted within a `src/` directory within the challenge directory. Once you have completed the challenge please move onto the next one and follow that challenge's instructions.

### Completing the challenges

Once you have completed the challenges you are done! üèÜ
