# Challenge 2: HTML/CSS And Javascript aka The Web!

### Description
This challenge is all about testing your basic understanding and ability to program in web languages!

During this challenge you will be asked to make a website to a basic brief and deliver this within a `src/` directory.

### Sources/Prerequisites

1. An IDE or Text editor of your choice (recommendations below)
   1. [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   2. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
   3. [Phpstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
   4. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. A web browser like Chrome

### The challenge

The challenge is to produce a web application with exactly 3 files:
1. `index.html`
2. `style.css`
3. `app.js`

This application is going to be a calculator! I know, how exciting but the whole point of this challenge isn't to waste a bunch of time thinking of anything to make or how it should work.

The application will require the math and user input to be handled by Javascript, the styling and formatting to be done in basic HTML and CSS using any materials you like. You may copy styling from the web, however, you must make sure to cite it when you do or else you will be penalised.
So, a calculator is the basic brief, and you are free to take any inspiration from designs you know of or anything you can find on the internet.

The calculator needs to be able to do the following with only 2 numbers:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

It is expected to function like such:
```
User Input: 88
User Input: +
User Input: 12
User Input: =
Output: 100
```

And for now that is all, feel free to add extras if you feel them necessary but it only needs to add/subtract/multiply/divide two numbers and nothing more.

### Brief
> Note you do not have to worry about sanitising the user input or allowing the user to use their keyboard to enter number's etc unless specified in the brief.

Now for the design you must follow the basic principles of a standard calculator test being the following:
1. A single output screen which shows the user's input and then display's the result it once the enter button is pressed or a "=" button is clicked.
2. The user must have a clear button that reset's the calculator, so we can do the next calculation (it does not have to auto reset)
3. The calculator must output the correct answer for the user's input

You are free to approach this task however you see fit but understand that good practices and principles are going to be reviewed as well as some tests performed to ensure it works.

This is expected to take no longer than 2-3 hours to complete and if you need any help please ask! If this is going to take you longer it would be easier to go through it together!

#### Challenge Completed! ðŸŽ–
Now using the principles from challenge 1 please submit this work to a new Github repository for review!

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] Create a project directory `/src`
- [ ] Create the 3 files
- [ ] Produce HTML and CSS that when opened looks like a calculator
- [ ] Produce Javascript that can handle basic user input
- [ ] It can function like a calculator for 2 numbers
- [ ] We can reset the calculator
- [ ] It produces the correct output
- [ ] You upload it to Github

## Extras!
Now that you have completed this task you have demonstrated an ability to produce usable web code so excellent work and it's time to move to the next challenge!
